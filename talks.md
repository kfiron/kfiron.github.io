# The Art of Decomposing Monoliths
Microservices are the new black. You've heard about them, you've read about them, you may have even implemented a few, but sooner or later you'll run into the age-old conundrum: How do I break my monolith apart? Where do I draw service boundaries?

In this talk you will learn several widely-applicable strategies for decomposing your monolithic application, along with their respective risks and the appropriate mitigation strategies. These techniques are widely used at Wix, took us a long time to develop and have proven consistently effective; hopefully they will help you avoid the same battle scars.

# Scala from the Trenches
In this live coding session in Scala, Kfir Bloch (head of back-end engineering at Wix) will showcase how to build a full-blown feature in Scala, while maintaining the principles of TDD and Clean Code. We'll start with some simple scaffolding and build the feature in its entirety: defining the user-facing API, writing tests outside-in with all of the requisite building blocks (collaborators and matchers), development-refactoring cycles and ending up with a clean codebase.
