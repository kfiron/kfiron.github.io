Developer, Manager, Architect (I hate this title). Currently leading the backend engineering in Wix.com.


Few more facts about me:
* I love type safety when i need it, and i love dynamic types when i don't need types
* Passionate about open source software and the community
* Live coder, for me coding is social thing, coding in public makes everyone better
* I don't like frameworks. They gives you good pace in the "hello world" but worst pace when you need more than that
* You'll get clean code only when you'll believe that "your code is never clean"
* YAGNI syndrom can drag you to bad performance
* TDD is only one tool in the box for deliver product in high quality and good pace
