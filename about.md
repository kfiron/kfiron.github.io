Currently the backeng engineering manager @ Wix.com. 
Sometimes I love Scala and the type system, sometimes i love Node.js hacking. 
I am not into front-end development, but i am enthusiastic about isomorphic code and server side rendereing using Node.js.

I also like to talk in meetups and conferences, but mainly run talks around live coding, i believe that live coding can give the audience the hightest value in 40 minutes.

I also love architecture and i spend my day to day job in this area.
