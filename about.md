<p>
Currently backeng engineering manager @ Wix.com. 
I like to solve complex problems in software engineering, mainly problems around architecture. I am TDD lover, I don't believe that TDD gives you better design, because better design is not created from the test, it created from refactoring and from trying to make the code cleaner. But without TDD i would not be able to refactor without fear.

Few more facts about me:
</p>
* I love type safety, however i hate it in a place we need to be too dynamic.
* Don't talk to me about CAP theorem, i want to be consistent, avilable and partition tolerance
* I believe that full stack developers are unicorns
* I hate when people tells me: "This happens ocassionaly". Please be more deterministic
